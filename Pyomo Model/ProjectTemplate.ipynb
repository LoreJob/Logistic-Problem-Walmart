    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "The board of Walmart Inc. commissioned an analysis of different scenarios of potential entry in the Italian market. The main issue that walmart faces when entering a different country relates to the cultural affinity of the customers for Walmart's brand and value proposition. For this reason, the board decided to start operating only in the Lombardia region. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the operation is maximizing profits of the first twenty years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Profits are estimated by subtracting the initial investment expenses to the present value of the expected EBITDA (earnings before depreciation and amortization, margine operativo lordo) over the twenty years period. The initial investments will have to include the purchasing price of the properties as well as the costs associated with constructing the stores.\n",
    "\n",
    "The present value of future EBITDA over a long period can be calculated by first estimating a yearly EBITDA, and then adding together all the discounted values by a rate of 10%.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, a store's EBITDA is proportional to its number of customers. People are less likely to go into a store if they live far away from it. However, larger stores will attract more customers than smaller ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "The board wants to know how many stores should be opened and where. The main challenge is finding suitable locations. A Walmart store is built on a large lot of land that has room for a large parking lot. For this reason empty lots are preferred to preexisting commercial buildings. Lots have to be within 20 and 60 thousands square meters.\n",
