    "The board of Walmart Inc. commissioned an analysis of different scenarios of potential entry in the Italian market. The goal of the operation is gaining the lagest market share in the quickest amount of time. The board wants to know for each scenario how many retail locations should be opened and where. The main challenge is finding suitable locations. A Walmart store is built on a large lot of land that has room for a large parking spaces. For this reason empty lots are preferred to preexisting commercial buildings. Stores need to be placed near, or relatively close to a highway to reach the widest amount of customers."
