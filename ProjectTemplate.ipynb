    "\n",
    "The board of Walmart Inc. commissioned an analysis of different scenarios of potential entry in the Italian market. The main issue that walmart faces when entering a different country relates to the cultural affinity of the customers for Walmart's brand and value proposition. For this reason, the board decided to start operating only in the Lombardia region. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the operation is maximizing profits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Profits can be estimated by adding the EBITDA (margine operativo lordo) of the first 5 years minus the cost of purchasing the property and the cost of building the store.\n",
    "\n",
    "The board wants to know how many retail locations should be opened and where. The main challenge is finding suitable locations. A Walmart store is built on a large lot of land that has room for a large parking lot. For this reason empty lots are preferred to preexisting commercial buildings. Lots have to be within 20 and 60 thousands square kilometers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The EBITDA of a store depends on the population that is near the location and the size of the store. Only one store can consider a comune's population as its potential customer base. The store will attract a higher share of customers from a comune if it is larger and if it is closer to that comune\n",
