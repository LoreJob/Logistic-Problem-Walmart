This project aims to analyze optimal store locations for a chosen company, exemplified by a Walmart supermarket chain but applicable to any business. The process involves various functions within the code: web scraping to identify available land, an API to obtain coordinates of selected locations, and a distance calculation function accounting for the Earth's curvature. The code offers flexibility, allowing modification of parameters to suit specific purposes. While the results aren't unique due to this adaptability, they provide practical insights. However, it's crucial to validate assumptions and results through testing and real-world data. Despite the comprehensive approach, unexpected factors may affect the practicality of outcomes. In conclusion, the combination of our assumptions and the code appears promising, but further refinement and validation are necessary for practical application.
